<h1>The Blog Social Media Server API</h1>

This is the backend of [The Blog social media](https://github.com/muhhx/TheBlog-Frontend)

It's a RESTful API built with NodeJS + Express + MongoDB that receives, process and delivers all the data from the frontend through Restful APIs.

## About this Project
- **Live website:** <https://theblogsocial.herokuapp.com/>
- **Frontend repository:** <https://github.com/muhhx/TheBlog-Frontend>
  
The idea of the app was to create a social media similar to Medium, where you can create, share, and interact with blog posts from other users.

The social media is completely functional, including Authentication, integration with third-party services and with many more functionalities that enhance the user experience (I've actually put a lot of effort in making a good user experiences in all of the pages, with loading status for API calls, etc.)
